I attended the Boston stop of the [CocoaConf][cocoaconf] tour this year.
As always, it was a quality experience. I learned a ton, and I'm still
processing all the valuable information that was crammed into my brain.
The Klein family puts together a great mix of technical content, community
interaction, and fun events.

The speakers were top notch.
I got to meet [Ben Scheirman][ben] of [NSScreenCast][nsscreencast] fame,
who I've admired for a long time. Both of his talks were packed full of useful
information. [Laura Savinola][savinola] had my favorite session, which was
basically 45 straight minutes of Xcode tips, tricks, and hacks.
(Lots of note-taking in that one!)

The event is paced so that the technical content is buffered with 15 minute
breaks, less technical talks, and meals in-between. In my opinion, this
prevents your brain from being completely overwhelmed with technical content.
