I have wanted to get better at unit testing and the tooling around it for some
time. I usually start out determined to get a good amount of the code covered
by unit tests, and to possibly get some UI tests built around user interactions.
Unfortunately, deadlines intervene, and the tests get abandoned. With my most
recent project, I decided to put all of these practices in place.

This is going to require learning as I go, and I intend to document my
progress here for my own learning and hopefully to help anyone else who is
researching the same thing.

I intend to use the following technologies:

- Unit testing using standard the OCUnit/SenTest frameworks included with Xcode
	- I’ve flirted with other projects in the past, including [Kiwi][github] .
	I really like the syntax and organization that Kiwi provides, but I want to
	stick with the out of the box stuff for now
- Integration/UI testing with [Frank][testingwithfrank]. I’ve got a fair amount
of experience with Frank. I’ve also played with [KIF][github 2], and much
prefer the separation and tooling that Frank provides
- Continuous Integration using [Jenkins][jenkins-ci]
- Build versioning using a build script for automated version increments
for release builds

I’m going to try to document my thought process and all the steps I take along
the way. Hopefully, I can get some constructive feedback on any improvements I
can make.
