Just a quick tip. This blog is built using [Octopress][octopress].
Octopress uses [Jekkyl][github] to create a static HTML site using markdown
files for the content. I’ve been slowly building up some markdown
specific [TextExpander][smilesoftware] snippets and [Keyboard Maestro][keyboardmaestro]
macros to make things easier.

I got some great Keyboard Maestro tips from Patrick Welker in
[this RocketInk article][km guide]. I’ve also been creating small TextExpander
snippets make it easier to put in blocks of code and other commonly used elements.

Here is one I recently created that I use a lot. When I type
`__ocb`, TextExpander creates a code block and places the cursor in the center
and ready to accept input. It also asks for the language in a drop down menu
(I’ve only included language selections as needed), and a title for the code
block. This adds the correct text in the initial line of the code block that
will add syntax coloring and a title to the top of the code block.

So, this (minus the underscores):

```

___ocb

```


turns into this:
{{< highlight obj-c >}}

NSLog(@“Testing”);

{{< /highlight >}}
