I’m going to try to do a post once per month detailing my current iPhone
homescreen. If it works out well, I might also do one a month for the iPad as
well. Below is a screenshot of my current homescreen.

## Some of my favorites

### Apple folder

Not a whole lot to note in here. This is just a quick collection of the stock
Apple apps. Mostly, it’s a place to quickly get to SMS, settings, the App
Store, and Mobile Safari.

#### [Camera Awesome][camera-awesome]

I’m using this one in place of the stock Apple camera app. It’s fast and has a
nice set of features, including big button (turns the entire screen into the
shutter button) and burst mode. I used Camera+ for a long time, but lately
it has become very slow to load and crashes a lot.

#### [Capture][capture]

Great utility app that does one thing well: launches a video recorder **fast**.

#### Mail

Need this one for work, since Sparrow doesn’t support exchange accounts.

### Dock
#### Phone

Does its job very well. I have no complaints.

#### [Sparrow][sparrow]

So far, the absolute best iOS mail app I have used. Sparrow still receives
periodic updates, even though it isn’t getting any further feature development.

#### [Fantastical][fantastical]

Agenda used to occupy this spot, but Fantastical introduced some very
thoughtful UI around the calendar, and it has the best blend of features and
functionality I have seen.

#### [Launch Center Pro][lcp]

Many posts have been written about how great this app is. I use it to get to
everything else on my phone. It has replaced 3 rows of apps on my homescreen.
The custom action support is awesome.
