In a current project, I had the need to have one specific view controller
present its view in landscape orientation only. Pre-iOS 6, I would have
overridden the `shouldAutoRotateToInterfaceOrientation` method and returned
`UIInterfaceOrientationLandscape`. In iOS 6, this method is deprecated. I began
researching how orientation issues should be handled going forward, and here is
the way I made my specific scenario work.

<!-- more -->

In iOS 6, the system queries the **topmost** visible view controller to see if
it should rotate.

The viewcontroller can override 2 methods to answer this query correctly:

* `supportedInterfaceOrientations:`
* `shouldAutoRotate`

It would seem simple enough to override these methods on each view controller
that had special requirements for presentation to have them determine their
orientation. The problem arose for me when I had a navigation controller
thrown into the mix. Since technically the topmost view controller in a
navigation stack is the navigation controller itself, iOS was ignoring the
method overrides I had in place for the individual view controllers. It was
sending the message directly to my UINavigationController, which did not
provide the settings I needed.

I solved this issue by subclassing UINavigationController and overriding the
previously mentioned methods, then passing the results from the navigation
controller down into the top view controller via the `topViewController`
property. Here are the steps to accomplish this:

1. Create a subclass of `UINavigationController`
2. Override the following methods:
	1. `-(UIInterfaceOrientation)preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation`
	2. `-(NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations`
	3. `-(BOOL)shouldAutorotate`
3. Return the result of each of these operations by passing in the value
from the result of calling that method on the topViewControllerof the
UINavigationController
4. Implement any or all of those methods specific to your needs on your
UIViewController subclasses
5. Make sure you are using your `UINavigationController` subclass in place of
the standard `UINavigationController`
	1. My project uses storyboards, so I simply specified my
	UINavigationController subclass in the Identity Inspector

Here is my implementation of the navigation controller subclass in its entirety:

{{< highlight obj-c >}}

@implementation FMNavigationController

-(BOOL)shouldAutorotate{
  return [self.topViewController shouldAutorotate];
}

-(NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations{
  return [self.topViewController supportedInterfaceOrientations];
}

-(UIInterfaceOrientation)preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation{
  return [self.topViewController preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation];
}

@end

{{< /highlight >}}

Then, in my specific view controller that needs to be launched in landscape,
I overrode this method and returned the appropriate value:

{{< highlight obj-c >}}

#pragma mark - Rotation
-(NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations{
  return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape;
}

{{< /highlight >}}

That’s really all there was to it. The research to get this right took much
longer than the implementation.

Please contact me with any questions, and good luck.
