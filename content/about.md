    Hi. I'm Mark Struzinski. I've been a software developer for 15+ years, and have been doing iOS for about 7. I'm an iOS dev lead for a major retailer. I love working on the iOS ecosystem. There is always something new to learn, or a new approach to try. 

    I enjoy helping others as much as developing software. In addition to writing on this website, I am also a co-organizer of the
    [Mooresville Mobile](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Dev-Meetup) meetup. If you are local to the Charlotte area, please come check 
    us out!

    <h4>About This Site</h4>

    <p>
        This site is built using the <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> static site generation library, using a 
        theme built by myself. It uses <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap 4</a> for styling, and 
        <a href="http://fontawesome.io">FontAwesome</a> for some of the custom icons. I learned these technologies solely to build this 
        site, and it was fun getting out of my comfort zone. I'll be making steady improvements and adding some 
        functionality going forward.
