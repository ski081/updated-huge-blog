Hi. I'm Mark Struzinski. I've been a software developer for 15+ years, and have been doing iOS for about 7. 
I'm an iOS dev lead for a major retailer. I love working on the iOS ecosystem. There is always something new to learn, or a new
approach to try. 

I enjoy helping others as much as developing software. In addition to writing on this website, I am also a co-organizer of the
[Mooresville Mobile](https://www.meetup.com/Mobile-Dev-Meetup) meetup. If you are local to the Charlotte area, please come check 
us out!
